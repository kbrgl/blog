## At school
The day started at school. I reached class 10 minutes late. After some excited chatter, I headed over to the computer lab where [Exun](//exun.co) gathers (we usually refer to this as the 'eGurukul lab', 'gurukul' being the Hindi word for school). There was plenty of excitement amongst my fellow event-goers because just like me, a lot of them were going to Code Wars for the first time.
<br><br>
After a fifteen-minute wait we left for DPS Vasant Kunj. The drive was a short one; we were there in fifteen minutes.

## DPS Vasant Kunj
The first thing I noticed about this school is how green it is. There's trees, gardens and flower pots everywhere. Compared to DPS RK Puram, DPS VK is like the Amazon rainforest. It's also massive in comparison to DPS RKP, but that's just because our school is tiny.
<br><br>
We were herded into a small room near the registration desk. This room was about the size of a large school bus and I was surprised to find out that this was what they called their \*auditorium\*. I couldn't quite understand why they needed microphones; you could hear people's whispers from across the room anyway. *[Incidentally, this is what I stated during my quiz finals, much to the quizmaster's annoyance. Apparently the people at DPS Vasant Kunj are insecure about the size of their auditorium. Ouch!]*
<br><br>
We were the first school to arrive (a rare occurence) and we blasted some tunes on my speaker in their auditorium. (Again, we didn't really need a dedicated speaker, a phone's speaker would probably have sufficed). After a long wait, we were taken to our event venue, their library, and handed the question papers for the preliminary round of the junior quiz. [Here's]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/cwjqprelims.pdf) the question paper. They gave us about half an hour to complete the paper. After completing the paper, the junior quiz participants and I were quickly ushered out of the library (which, again, overlooked a garden) and back into the auditorium. I knew I would qualify.
<br><br>
I was asked by one of our school's Creative Event participants to pose for some pictures she needed to take for her entry. The Creative Event participants had been asked to create a fitness app. Here's one of the pictures:

I don't know why I'm sticking my tongue out. Anyway, our team won the creative event, so it's something.
<br><br>
After a while, we had our quiz finals in the lil' auditorium. Apparently DPS Noida had made an unexpected entry - they'd arrived late but they'd been allowed to participate in the quiz and had qualified to the finals.
The finals weren't very difficult. The questions were nice and mostly workable. You can find the questions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/cwjqfinals.pdf). The finals had to be shortened because the quiz was running too long and we were only able to do 30 questions.
<br><br>
We came 2nd in the finals. DPS Noida beat us by a margin of 225 points - this was mostly because my partner and I made a ton of bad decisions throughout the finals and didn't pounce when we should have. Damn you, DPS Noida!
<br><br>
I emerged from the auditorium and was nearly blinded by the sunlight; the auditorium was totally dark and I'd been sitting in there for nearly an hour. For refreshments, we were given Burger King, which was nice.

After having some Burger King, we headed back to the auditorium to watch the Crossword finals. I've always found crosswords hard so I spent about 15-20 minutes staring at the clues with a confused look on my face.
<br><br>
The crossword was the last event of the day, so after the crossword we got in the bus and went back to school. The bus was somewhat quiet since everyone was pretty tired (I know I was). We'd got a podium at nearly every event we attended (which was all of them).

## Day 2
I wasn't there for day 2 because of a retest but we pretty much conquered day 2 as well, and won the overall. This was Exun's first big win this year, and only our second win in 2016.
